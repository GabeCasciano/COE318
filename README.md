## COE318 Labs
These are my labs for the COE318 course, these labs may be used as reference but I will ask
that they are not directly copied. All labs will be given their own branch until completed, once
completed they will be merged to the master branch.

Notice that there are two folders within the lab folders, one for IntelliJ and one for NetBeans.
Both will compile and run, but the projects are structured differently. The dual builds in the
result of the TA wanting the NetBeans project structure, thus the .zip to actualy submit the lab is
located in the NetBeans folder.
