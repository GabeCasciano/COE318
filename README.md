## COE318 Labs
These are my labs for the COE318 course, these labs may be used as reference but I will ask
that they are not directly copied. All labs will be given their own branch until completed, once
completed they will be merged to the master branch.

The IDE I am using is JetBrains IntelliJ, so the project format may not match every IDE. If you are
using a different IDE simply recompile the .java file.
